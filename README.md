# Binary Reflected Gray Code Visualization

## Overview
This project is designed to explain and visually demonstrate **Binary Reflected Gray Code (BRGC)**. The project provides educational step-by-step visualizations using **color-coded terminal outputs** and **delays** to help users understand how Gray codes are generated and how each bit changes in the sequence.

## Contents
- `README.md`: This markdown file containing important information about the project.
- `BRGC_Visualization.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook used to execute the program.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Educate users about Binary Reflected Gray Code and its applications.
- Provide clear, step-by-step visualizations of BRGC generation with color highlights to illustrate single-bit changes.
- Demonstrate the recursive algorithm behind Gray code construction.

## View Output
To view the output of this project, you can either:
- Open `BRGC_Visualization.ipynb` to see the code and all terminal visualizations.
- Run the Google Colab notebook on your own machine to interact with the explanations and demonstrations.

## How to Run
1. Open `BRGC_Visualization.ipynb` in Google Colab.  
2. Run the setup cells to import necessary libraries and initialize the program.  
3. Run the "Main" cell and follow the prompts to view the construction of the BRGC sequence in real time!
